How to Play
===========================================================================

Open the index.html file to load the rendered output into the browser.
The game Missile Command 3D is made to rediscover the famous arcade 2D game.
Essentially  there are two anti-missile bases(batteries) and the city consists of buildings.
The aim is to maximise your score by shooting down the missiles by correctly directing at incoming missiles.
Each level consists of 40 descending missiles. At each level the speed of descending missiles increases by a small factor to increase the level of difficulty. Randomly UFO objects can show which if hit, will earn the player extra points.
Play the game with the speaker on to have the full experience.

Score to shoot Missile = 1
Score to shoot UFO = 5
